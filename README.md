Another guide can be found [here](https://www.avforums.com/threads/hacking-samsung-bd-p1620a-bd-p3600.1245419/) on avforums, although I found it to be lacking in many respects. Although it is still a useful resource. 
### Part 0: Required supplies
1. A soldering iron
2. Something capable of UART (A raspberry pi is what I am using)
3. An Ethernet cable with a router to plug it into

### Part 1: Obtaining UART
For those unaware, UART ([Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter)) is a basic serial protocol that allows you to obtain a simple TTY, and lucky the BD-P3600 has easily accessible UART pins!
